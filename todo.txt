spectrum: shows informtion of different frequencies present and their magnitude.
spectrogram: shows informtion of different frequences present in time domain.

we require 2d-fft so that we can plot spctrogram with time, frequences and their magnitude.


1. Build spectrogram with both frequency and magnitude. (Done)

2. Develop dataset for new spectrograms. (Done)

3. Build model for new dataset. (Working)

4. Confirm the output of yolo and get more precised data for label. (Done)

5. Gather new data. (More Data with white drone)

6. Test yolo on new data. (Done) (White drone left)

7. Create audio file of data. (Done) (White drone left)

8. Collect frames from the video data. (Done) (White drone left)

9. Test yolo on the frame and save labels for student network. (Done) (White drone left)

10. Create audio chunks for new dataset. (Done) (White drone left)

11. Test acoustic model on test dataset. (Done)

12. Create video with loacalization from acoustic model. ()
